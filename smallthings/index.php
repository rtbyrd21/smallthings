The Bible makes the outlandish claim that Jesus is not just a good teacher or prophet, but savior and Lord over all creation, so that includes us carbon-based bipeds. And those who surrender to his lordship enter into a life-transformational and empowered relationship with him. Everything changes.</p>

              <p class="lead">Two words—repent & believe. Yeah, they sound pretty religious, but maybe not as scary as you think. It simply means to change the way you think and trust Jesus to forgive and change you. The reason we need to adjust the way we think is because we’re terrifically broken and separated from God…and need rescuing from ourselves: our self-centeredness, our shame, our brokenness, our sins. But in that process of asking forgiveness, we change the way we think about God and choose to believe him as he says he is: a spectacularly good Father who would offer his own Son as ransom for our souls. When we choose to believe Jesus is who he says he is—not only the gift from God but, in his words, “the way, the truth and the life”—then we are reborn spiritually into a life-changing, intimate relationship with God.</p>
              <p class="lead">You might even begin with a simple prayer, maybe something like:<i>“Jesus, I’ve been doing life my way and far apart from you. Forgive me for ignoring you and living the way I want, and come into my life fully and freely. Fill me with your Spirit and be my Lord and Savior. I choose you above all others.”</i></p>
<p class="lead">And with that…welcome to the family! Ask God to lead you to a local church, pick up a Bible that’s easy-to-read (start with the Gospel of Mark—it’s a quick overview of Jesus), and simply start having conversations with God—the Father who’s been looking for you.</p>
              <h5 class="followJes">Who can follow Jesus?</h5>
              <p class="lead">The Bible says anyone can follow Jesus – there is no limit to what you have done, or where you come from. Jesus calls people of every tribe and tongue. Anyone born into Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or atheist families must make the step to truly believe and trust Jesus. Only then can anyone know the true Way of God, following the Scriptures and applying the truth of the Good News that Jesus brought. The followers of Jesus in our city pray and worship in many different ways and languages, with different buildings, music, and statements of faith. He is called by different names – Jesus, Isa, Yeshua and Jesucristo – but we are one new people together in obeying him as the true Messiah of the world.</p>
